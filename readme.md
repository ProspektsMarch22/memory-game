# Javascript Memory Game
### A game made with vanilla javascript

This is another game made with javascript. Implementing modern javascript with some HTML and CSS, this is an exercise project in web development.

#### How to play

Select a first tile, and then a second one. If they match, they're then removed from the game, and a positive score is added.

###### In future versions, features and the look of it will be refined. This is a in-progress project

###### This project is based in Ania Kubow's "Learn Javascript by building games" video. All the images used are hers.
